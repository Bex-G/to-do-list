This is a task-manager/to-do list program that I've created in the style of a video game quest log (just for fun!). It enables a user to add their own quests, take note of any side quests, and log some of the steps they might take to complete these fantasy goals. 

This program uses JSON and localStorage methods, so any changes/additions the user makes can be saved and repopulated accordingly upon loading!
